# Sudoku-solver

Simple sudoku solver. It's just an exercise, and it could have been done much more effeciently. I didn't use any advanced tricks.
In this implementation it goes over several basic methods to reduces all possible states, and then tries guessing randomly elements that have only few possible numbers.
